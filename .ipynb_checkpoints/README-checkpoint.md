# Leveraging Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub for Enhanced STEM Content Creation and Learning Activities

This workshop is designed to bridge the gap between technology and education in the STEM fields. In today's digital era, leveraging modern tools like GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks is crucial for effective teaching and learning. The primary purpose of this workshop is to empower educators and enthusiasts with the skills to harness the power of GitHub for version control and to craft interactive STEM-related learning activities using Jupyter Notebooks. Whether you're a seasoned educator looking to infuse technology into your curriculum or a tech enthusiast keen on diving into STEM education, this workshop is tailored for you.

Learning Goals:

### 1. Master GitHub Basics:
* By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to create and manage a GitHub account, understand the fundamental concepts of version control, and demonstrate proficiency in performing basic Git operations, such as pulling and pushing content between local repositories and the cloud.

### 2. Develop Jupyter Notebook Competency for STEM Education:
* Participants will acquire the skills to design, create, and modify Jupyter Notebooks tailored for STEM learning activities. They will learn how to integrate code, visualizations, and rich text to craft interactive and engaging educational content.

### 3. Familiarity with Best Practices in STEM Education with Jupyter:
* By the end of the workshop, participants will have an introductory understanding of the best practices for using Jupyter Notebooks in STEM education. They will be introduced to strategies for creating effective learning content and will have a foundational knowledge to further explore and apply these practices in their own contexts.
