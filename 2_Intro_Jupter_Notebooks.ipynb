    "## 1. Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "### 1.1. What are Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are open-source interactive web applications that allow users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. The term \"Jupyter\" is derived from the core supported programming languages: Julia, Python, and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Why use Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "* Interactivity: Jupyter Notebooks allow for interactive coding, making it easier to test and debug code in real-time.\n",
    "* Visualization: Integrated support for visualizations with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.\n",
    "* Documentation: Combining code with narrative text helps in explaining complex ideas, making it an excellent tool for teaching and presentations.\n",
    "* Flexibility: Supports multiple languages and can be easily integrated with other tools and platforms.\n",
    "* Reproducibility: Ensures that experiments, data analyses, and tutorials can be easily reproduced by others.\n",
    "### 1.3. Jupyter vs. other IDEs\n",
    "While traditional IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like PyCharm, Eclipse, or VSCode are designed for software development, Jupyter Notebooks are tailored for data analysis, scientific computing, and educational purposes. Key differences include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nature: IDEs are application-based, while Jupyter is web-based.\n",
    "* Purpose: IDEs are suited for large-scale projects, whereas Jupyter is more for interactive experimentation.\n",
    "* Interactivity: Immediate feedback in Jupyter due to cell-by-cell execution.\n",
    "* Integration: Jupyter integrates markdown and code in one document.\n",
    "## 2. Getting Started with Jupyter\n",
    "### 2.1. Installation\n",
    "#### 2.1.1. Installing Python and pip\n",
    "Before installing Jupyter, you need Python and pip (Python package manager) on your system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download the latest version of Python from python.org.\n",
    "* Install Python, ensuring the \"Add Python to PATH\" option is checked during installation.\n",
    "* Verify the installation by opening a terminal and typing python --version.\n",
    "* Ensure pip is installed with pip --version.\n",
    "#### 2.1.2. Installing Jupyter using pip\n",
    "Once Python and pip are set up:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "* Run the command pip install jupyter.\n",
    "* Wait for the installation to complete.\n",
    "#### 2.1.3. Using Conda for installation\n",
    "If you use the Anaconda distribution of Python, you can install Jupyter using Conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download and install Anaconda or Miniconda.\n",
    "* Open the Anaconda prompt.\n",
    "* Run the command conda install jupyter.\n",
    "### 2.2. Launching Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "After installation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "Navigate to your desired directory using cd <directory_name>.\n",
    "Run the command jupyter notebook.\n",
    "A new browser window/tab should open with the Jupyter Notebook interface, showing the files in your current directory.\n",
    "### 2.3. Notebook Interface Basics\n",
    "#### 2.3.1. Menu bar\n",
    "The menu bar at the top provides options to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* File: Create a new notebook, open an existing one, save, rename, and download notebooks.\n",
    "* Edit: Cut, copy, paste, and delete cells.\n",
    "* View: Adjust the user interface display settings.\n",
    "* Insert: Insert new cells into the notebook.\n",
    "* Kernel: Start, restart, or stop the execution kernel.\n",
    "#### 2.3.2. Toolbar\n",
    "Below the menu bar, the toolbar provides shortcuts for common actions, like adding new cells, running cells, and adjusting cell types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.3. Cells\n",
    "The main area of a notebook consists of cells. There are three types of cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code Cells: Allow you to write and run code.\n",
    "* Markdown Cells: Used for adding text, which can include markdown formatting for headers, lists, links, and more.\n",
    "* Raw Cells: Allow you to write output directly, without execution.\n",
    "* To execute a cell, press Shift + Enter. The output will appear below the cell."
